## Ignore Errors file for <NAME> repository

## If a package generates trivial errors during updateMyRepo() you can
## list it here. For example, some packages cause problems during PDF
## generation. The errors are not important but can alarm your
## users. List them here to silence display of errors for those
## packages. For example, this line:

examplePackageNotActuallyReal

## ... would prevent errors from being displayed while processing the
## package named 'examplePackageNotActuallyReal'. Blank lines and
## lines starting with a number sign are ignored.
