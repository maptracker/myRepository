## Configuration Script Archive

This folder holds both the current and past configuration scripts. If
you have an interest in being able to reproduce your workflow, we
strongly recommend that you maintain a history of your changes to
these scripts. This of course could be done with a version control
system, but by maintaining each script as a distinct file name it can
make it easier for you to replicate past settings on-the-fly.

The "current" script should be accessed by a symlink present at
`../configureRepo.R`. If you add an updated script to this folder, be
sure to also repoint that symlink.
