### <NAME> Package Releases

This folder collects the `.tar.gz` files generated by `R CMD BUILD`
when run on the package directory (source files can be found in
[../<NAME>](../<NAME>)). You can install any of these versions by
running:


```R
install.packages("/path/to/package")
## Or:
install.packages("https://repository.url/path/to/package")
```

The [current](current) symlink will point to the most recent package
version. Unfortunately the symlink will not properly resolve when
accessed as a GitHub __URL__ in `install.packages`. It will work fine
as a __file__ access, however.
