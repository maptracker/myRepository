New repository! Nothing has been added yet. Run:

<pre>
source("<CONFSCRIPT>")
updateMyRepo()
</pre>

... to generate your repository's landing page. You will need to be
working on a system that has your repo's local file system mounted,
and will need to have system permissions to modify files there.
