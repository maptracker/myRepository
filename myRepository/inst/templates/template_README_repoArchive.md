## Repository Archive

This folder holds `tar.gz` R package files that have been removed from
[src/contrib](../src/contrib).

In general, if you are attempting to set up a Reproducible Research
framework, it's highly advisable to leave all old package versions in
`src/contrib`. This allows the opportunity to install specific package
versions as needed, even if they are not current.

In some circumstances, it might be desirable or even neccesary to make
some packages unavailable. The easiest way to do this is, of course,
to simply delete those files. However, moving the files to this folder
will allow you to easily revert your decision should you decide to do
so.
