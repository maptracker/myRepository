RemoveMe: You should remove this block, it is instructional
    only; Delete down to the 'DELETE-TO-HERE' line.
    You should first, however, address the following sections - 
      Title - should be a single short sentence describing the package
      Authors@R - should list all the contributors. Be careful, the block
        needs to be parsable R code, so mind parentheses, quotes and commas.
        Should be at least one author, but can be more. Each person() block
        starts with ("Given/First Name", "Last/Surname"), then has contact
        email and 'role' flags, popular ones being -
          cre=creator (and the 'Maintainer' contact), aut=author (major author),
          ctb=contributor (minor author), cph=copyright holder (eg a company)
      Description - Like title, but intended to be a more detailed description
      URL - optional website for the package (eg a public repo). Can delete
      BugReports - optional URL to issue tracker, can delete
      Imports - Roxygen will NOT manage the Depends/Imports blocks for
        you. You need to update the packages listed there
        manually. Currently crayon and stats are listed, which are
        used in the demo methods. Delete them if you are not using
        them. If you know you're calling functions with '::', use
        Imports to list packages. Otherwise use Depends. Mind your commas.
    You may wish to change -
      Version - you're starting as '0.0.1', can change (eg '1.0', '1.0.1', etc)
      License - for an exhaustive list of options, see:
        https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/share/licenses/license.db
        Popular licenses are: MIT, LGPL-3, GPL-3, GPL-2

Description: Be verbose here. Describe what the package does, the situations
    you anticipate it being used in. How it distinguishes itself from other
    packages. Be free to highlight its strengths, but if it has limitations
    this would be a helpful place to point them out or suggest other
    packages that might be more appropriate.
